// sign in. `redirect` throws, which leaves the SDK's error path the same way a
// returned error would.
//
// It goes to `/session/reset`, not straight to `/login`. The cookie the API
// just rejected is still a *valid* better-auth session, so a login page would
// see a signed-in user and bounce right back to the page that 401'd. Disposing
// of the dead session is this failure's business, not the login page's, and a
