/**
 * Disposes of a session the API has rejected, then lands on /login.
 *
 * A Learn read answering 401 means the cookie no longer resolves to a portal
 * student, but better-auth still considers it a live session — so it has to be
 * revoked, not merely navigated away from. A Server Component render cannot set
 * cookies; a route handler can, which is why the 401 path redirects here
 * (`lib/api/server-call.ts`) instead of to the login page.
 *
 * Sign-out is delegated to the API, which owns the cookie: we forward the raw
 * `Cookie:` header and relay its `Set-Cookie` responses verbatim. Nothing here
 * names a cookie, so prefixes (`__Secure-`), `crossSubDomainCookies` and the
 * signed session-data cache stay the API's business — the same
 * forward-don't-reconstruct rule `lib/auth/server-session.ts` follows.
