 * The invite landing page's only API call.
 *
 * Runs on the Next server so the browser never talks to the API directly: the
 * session cookie minted by the sign-up/sign-in that just happened rides along on
 * the action request and is forwarded verbatim (see `lib/api/server-call.ts`).
 *
 * The token is the one from the invite link. The API re-derives the invitee's
 * email from the invitation row and refuses a token whose email doesn't match
 * the session, so nothing here is steerable from the query string.
